I'm reading [The Economy](https://core-econ.org/the-economy/?lang=en), [The Visual Display of Quantitative
Information](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17744.The_Visual_Display_of_Quantitative_Information) and learning to
do data stuff with Python, and I'm gonna use this repository to store the things I do as part of that learning. It's
going to be a kind of collection of notes in code and charts.
